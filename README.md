MP-Element
==========

MP-Element began as a new, generalized network and element modeling
layer for [MATPOWER][1] and grew into a complete redesign and rewrite
of the [MATPOWER][1] internals.

---
---
>> ### NOTE: MP-Element has been incorporated into MATPOWER 8.
>> 
>> _As of Dec 14, 2022, all further development will be done in the main [MATPOWER repository][1]._
>>
>>_The components initially developed in this MP-Element repository are now included in MATPOWER and referred to as **MP-Core** and the **legacy** and **flexible MATPOWER frameworks**. For more information, see the [Architecture Overview][10] in the [MATPOWER Developer's Manual][9]._

>>_The information below was relevant for MP-Element and development versions of MATPOWER prior to Dec 14, 2022._

System Requirements
-------------------
*   [MATLAB][2] version 9.1 (R2016b) or later, or
*   [GNU Octave][3] version 6.2 or later
*   A version of [MATPOWER][1] that explicitly includes support for
    MP-Element  
    _The `master` branch of the [MATPOWER GitHub repository][1] now includes
    the required support. See the [CHANGES][8] file._


Installation
------------

Installation and use of MP-Element requires familiarity with the basic operation
of MATLAB or Octave, including setting up your MATLAB/Octave path.

1.  Clone the repository or download and extract the zip file of the MP-Element
    distribution from the [MP-Element project page][4] to the location of your
    choice.

2.  Either ...
  - Move the resulting `mp-element` directory to the directory
    containing MATPOWER (must be a version that supports MP-Element),
    and re-run `install_matpower` (the directory must be named
    `mp-element` for the installer to recognize its presence),  
  ... _or_ ...
  - Add the following directories to your MATLAB/Octave path:
    * `<MPELEMENT>/lib`
    * `<MPELEMENT>/lib/t`

    where `<MPELEMENT>` is used to denote the path to the `mp-element`
    directory you cloned or unzipped in step 1.

3.  At the MATLAB/Octave prompt, type `test_mp_element` to run the test
    suite and verify that MP-Element is properly installed and functioning.
    The result should resemble the following:
```
  >> test_mp_element
  t_mp_mapped_array.........ok
  t_mp_table................ok
  t_mp_data_model...........ok
  t_mp_dm_converter_mpc2....ok
  t_nm_element..............ok
  t_port_inj_current_acc....ok
  t_port_inj_current_acp....ok
  t_port_inj_power_acc......ok
  t_port_inj_power_acp......ok
  t_node_test...............ok
  t_run_mp..................ok
  t_run_mp_3p...............ok
  All tests successful (2075 of 2075)
  Elapsed time 29.94 seconds.
```


Getting Started
---------------

#### Default Behavior

With MP-Element installed, its modeling is used by default by MATPOWER's
`runpf`, `runcpf` and `runopf` for the following:
  - DC power flow
  - DC optimal power flow
  - AC power flow for all except radial and hybrid Newton-Raphson
    formulations/solvers
    - a new `'FSOLVE'` option based on `fsolve()` function is available for
      AC power flow
  - AC continuation power flow
  - AC OPF for solvers MIPS, `fmincon`, IPOPT, and Artelys Knitro, for
    all formulations

MP-Element modeling can be turned off in favor of the legacy MATPOWER modeling
with `have_feature('mp_element', 0)`.

Note: The MP-Opt-Model object is used for power flow and continuation power
flow as well as OPF and is added as `om` field to power flow and CPF `results`
struct.

#### New Functions

In addition to the old `runpf`, `runcpf` and `runopf` functions which are
backward compatible when using the MP-Element modeling, there are 3 new
corresponding functions, namely `run_pf`, `run_cpf` and `run_opf`. They are
simple wrappers around a new _(unfinished)_ function, `run_mp`, which does
not convert the MATPOWER case struct to internal numbering before use, and
will eventually provide a much more flexible environment for customization.


Documentation
-------------

Given that this code is **under active development**, the documentation is
very incomplete and sometimes missing entirely (i.e. the code _is_ the
documentation).

#### Technical Note

The following MATPOWER Technical Note describes some of the design of
MP-Element.
